## Problem Statement: 
>It's play time, people!    
Many kids initial fascination with computers, like that of nerdy kids, had to do with computer games. They were drawn into the tiny simulated worlds that they could manipulate and in which stories (sort of) unfolded—more, I suppose, because of the way they projected their imagination into them than because of the possibilities they actually offered.  
I don’t wish a career in game programming on anyone. Much like the music industry, the discrepancy between the number of eager young people wanting to work in it and the actual demand for such people creates a rather unhealthy environment. **But writing games for fun is amusing**.  
>### 3.Tic-tac-toe
>Tic-Tac-Toe is about Os and Xs or noughts and crosses . The rule of the game is very simple. On a 3x3 grid, a player has to match 3 consecutive Os or Xs horizontally/vertically/diagonally.

## Instructions
While working on a large project, it's a good idea to spend sometime planning. Some of the things you can plan are: 
- Break down the product into multiple versions like 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 etc
    - For e.g. 0.1 could be only the CLI game, 0.2 could be 0.1 with Front end, 0.3 could be 0.2 with jQuery methods and so on.. 
- Decide what's your [MVP]
